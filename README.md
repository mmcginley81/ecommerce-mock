# User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# Experience
This was a vital learning experience on how to set up an e-commerce platform on the server end through sequelize. We joined tables and tested all of our CRUD requests through Insomnia. This data is an MVP that would be ready to be a functioning API for a user who has set up a front end part of an e-commerce platform.

# Video
Please watch this video on how the application runs and what get post put and delete requests are available across the Category, Product and Tag tables.
